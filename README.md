Created a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra to improve data analysis for a music streaming app. The goal was to analyze user activity data to understand which songs were most popular and how users listened to music. Key tasks included:

1. Setting up a Cassandra cluster to handle large amounts of data efficiently.
2. Designing keyspaces and tables to organize user and song information.
3. Writing queries to extract useful insights, such as favorite songs, most active listening times, and user engagement trends.

This project replaced a slower, CSV-based data storage system, making it easier and faster to access data. As a result, query performance improved, enabling better analysis and more responsive reporting on user behavior.
