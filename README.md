Developed a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra to optimize data analysis for a music streaming application. The project focused on modeling and querying user activity data to gain insights into song preferences and listening habits. Key tasks included setting up a Cassandra cluster, designing keyspaces and tables, and executing efficient queries to uncover meaningful patterns from the dataset. This solution successfully replaced the prior CSV-based storage system, significantly improving data accessibility and query performance.
